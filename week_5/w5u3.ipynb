    "\n",
    "In the previous units you have seen that you can use functions with parameters. There are cases, where no parameter is\n",
    "needed in a function, for example a function for some kind of greeting, which should always be the same. Or a function\n",
    "which will write the current time in a predefined format to a terminal or a log.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters, however make it possible to customize these functions to your need. In case of the above examples, you could\n",
    "add a name to the greeting to personalize it or use a parameter in the *current time*-function to change the formatting\n",
    "of the output, e.g. 24h/12h format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters make it possible to *reuse* a function for different inputs and do the same operation on different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A function has an optional parameter list. This means that a function has either:\n",
    "- no parameter\n",
    "- one parameter\n",
